# Pitfails

A small collection of code snippets that were used as a challenge at 
2024's PHDays 2 event by Positive Labs team.

The intent of a snippet is to hide a bug in a plain sight, creating such a code
that would fail only on some exotic input. The challenge was dedicated to promotion of
fuzz testing - with fuzzer running aside on a TV display.

The event span four days, and so some snippets were tweaked at night
to mitigate answer sharing. Sorry (not really) about that, free branded 
socks lovers, lol.

`src` dir contains the snippets as python modules - you can run them from a command line. Most modules 
have inside a string that should crash them.

`src/proposed` dir contains snippets submitted during PHDays 2 Fest by the participants. They received 
rewards for this, but unfortunately we haven't thought about asking for a name from them at the time. 
If you see your snippet here - tell us, we will assign a copyright.

`src/unused` dir contains snippets made by us, but those are not finished
